==============

# A small game, written in Javascript.

[https://geleeroyale.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/](https://geleeroyale.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
* Local: Clone or download the repo, then open index.html in a web-browser.

## How to play:

There is only one rule: 'Nobody talks about time loop horror!'
Except from that, there are only *some* other rules, like:

### Enemies and movement

The enemies are stupid
Touching them returns you to your starting position
Falling into the water returns you to your starting position
You cannot leave the playing field
Welcome to eternal doom!

### Keyboard commands

You control doomed char-boy with the arrow keys
Again, there is no escape (except through console ;-)
